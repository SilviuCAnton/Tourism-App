# Tourism application - CS - Object Oriented Programming
An app for managing tourism offers. It displays the current offers in a table and lets you add/remove/modify an offer to the list, 
filter the offers by name/destination/price, sort them by name/destination/type+price. It also comes with the posibility of creating 
a wishlist. You can populate the wishlist with random offers, add offers manually or clear all the offers from the wishlist. The wishlist 
can be seen from it's specific window, or you can see the items in the wishlist represented by a picture in another window.

C++ programming language

## What I Learned
* Fundamentals of the C++ programming language
* Object Oriented Programming fundamentals - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism
* Generic C++ programming using templates - implemented a generic list
* The stl functions and data structures (vectors, maps, algorithm.h, iterators)
* How to avoid mistakes like slicing (polimorphism) and write exception safe code (smart pointers)
* Smart pointers - the unique pointer from stl
* The Qt framework - how to create graphical user interfaces manually (using the framework, not drag and drop)
* Observer and Model-View design patterns
* C++ const correction
* C++ rule of three (copy constructor, copy assignment and destructor)
* Test driven development using assert function (from assert.h)
